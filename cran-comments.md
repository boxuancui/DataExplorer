## Notes
<<<<<<< HEAD
The package showed a warning status for both `debian-clang-devel` and `fedora-clang-devel`, so I checked both from RHub and it is not reporting any new errors. I have also checked all other platforms without warnings and errors. Please see below for more details. Thank you!

## Test environments
* Mac OS X 10.15.7 (local install), R 4.0.3
